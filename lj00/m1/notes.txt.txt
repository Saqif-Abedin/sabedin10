Database: structured way to store and access Data
NoSQL Database: related tables of Data  
    -organized, but not in rows and columns
MongoDB is a NoSQL documentDB: data is stored as documents
    -documents are stored in collection of documents

Documents: A way tp prganize and store data as a set of field-value pairs
    -field is unique identifier for data points
    -value is data related to identifier
    example:
        "name" : "Saqif"

Collection: organized store of documents, usually with common fields between documents  
    example:
        {
            "name"  : "Saqif"
            "title" : "Student"
            "age"   : 17
        }
    *Database contains a bunch of collections*

Atlas is cloud Database with MongoDB at core
Cluster Deployment
    Clusters: group of servers that store data
            servers are configured in a replica set
    Replica Set: a few connected MongoDB instances that store the same data
    Instance: single machine (local or cloud) running a certain software
    *ensures that if something happens to one machine in the replica set, data will be intact*
Services
    -manage cluster creation
    -run and maintain database deployment
    -use cloud service provider of choice
    -experiment with new tools and features
